Developed a HELLO DOCTOR (A platform for Doctor and patient 
communication. Online prescription system, doctors Schedule 
management, patient schedule track, NEARBY DOCTORS from 
patients home location) , (Language – NodeJs(Express framework,
 Frontend :EJS file, Database : Mysql); IDE – Sublime , Brackets, Notepad++)
 
 please must install node from "https://nodejs.org/en/" import atpfinal.sql from this folder "sql file"->"atpfinal.sql" on your local mysql
 and update then npm json file pacakge.json and for that you have to hellow doctor directory from command prom and run this command "npm i --save" or "npm update" on your local repository to run the project :)
if everything goes sucssfully from command prom in to hellow doctor directory run this command
"node app.js" so the app will start on defined port in app.js and then open browser and go to this url "localhost:3000"
hope everything will run successfully in sha allah.
